		ALGORITM TO FIND THE SQUARE ROOT OF A NUMBER

1. START
2. Find the square root of a number = (number, epsilon=1e-6)
3. Take a guess (half of the input number)
     guess = number/2
4. while (guess*guess-number > epsilon):
      If condition = true
       continue 
        else stop and print guess
          else repeat until condition is false
     Update the guess create (new_guess = guess + number / guess) / 2
5. Once the loop has beeen exited, print square root = guess
